# TUINO LIBS

Here you will find the various libraries and example files to use all the hardware that its available with the  Tuino  1. Both the standard onboard options: **NFC**, **RTC**, **LiPO** and some information on the 1WIRE chip which is used currently just to identify the GMX modules. 
We have separated the files into 2 directories:

* TUINO HW
Libraries and examples to use the onboard hardware

* GMX
Libraries and examples for the GMX modules
